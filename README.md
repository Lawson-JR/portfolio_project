# Game eCommerce Frontend App

## Overview
This is a **game eCommerce frontend app** built with **React**, **Redux**, **Tailwind CSS**, **Vite**, and **FontAwesome**. It allows users to browse a large collection of games, add items to their cart, manage favorites, track orders and sign up or log in. All user data, including cart and favorites, are stored locally using **localStorage** since there is no backend.

## Features
- **Game Catalog**: Browse a massive collection of games with search, filter, and sorting options.
- **User Authentication**: Simple login and signup functionality with localStorage for session persistence.
- **Cart Management**: Users can add and remove games from their cart, with items saved across sessions.
- **Favorites**: Mark and unmark games as favorites, saved in localStorage.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive layout, optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

## Tech Stack
- **React**: Component-based architecture for dynamic user interfaces.
- **Redux**: Global state management for handling user session, cart, and favorites.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling and responsive design.
- **Vite**: Fast build tool for development and production bundling.
- **FontAwesome**: Icon library for navigation, buttons, and various UI elements.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Lawson-JR/portfolio_project.git
   cd portfolio_project
   
2. Run the application:
   ```bash
   cd eCommerce\ Frontend\ Web/
   npm run dev

## Usage
- **Browse Games**: On the home page, view the available games. Use the search bar, filters, and sorting to find specific games.
- **Login/Signup**: Create a user account or log in. This will store your user session in localStorage.
- **Add to Cart** : Select games to add to your cart. The cart can be accessed from the top right of the page.
- **Favorites**: Mark games as favorites to save them for later.
- **LocalStorage Management**: User data, cart, and favorites are stored in the browser's localStorage to persist between sessions. No sensitive information (e.g., passwords) is stored in localStorage due to its limitations.
